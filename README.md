============
Compiler project for CMPS104a

From the program spec:

"Write a main program for the language oc that you will be compiling
this quarter.  Also, include a string set ADT for it, and make it
preprocess the program using the C preprocessor, /usr/bin/cpp.  The
main program will be called from Unix according the usage given below
under the synopsis.  This means that your compiler will read in a
single oc program, possibly with some options, as described below.

The name of the compiler is oc and the file extension for programs
written in this language will be .oc as well.  Option letters are
given with the usual Unix syntax.  All debugging output should be
printed to the standard error, not the standard output.  Use the
macros DEBUGF and DEBUGSTMT to generate debug output.  (See the
example expr-smc, module auxlib).

SYNOPSIS:
     oc [-ly] [-@ flag...]  [-D string] program.oc "
